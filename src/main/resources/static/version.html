		<h3>This deployment is a SNAPSHOT version</h3>
		<p>
			A SNAPSHOT version is a development version based on the most recent
			source code (called <i>the head</i>) at the moment this snapshot was built.
			Thus, this deployment is a work in progress and may not be fully working.
			This deployment is also not repeatable, since the source code used in
			this deployment has likely moved on and there is no way to deploy
			another snapshot <em>just like this one</em>.
		</p>
		<p>
			The links below go to the source code and change list.
			Note that the snapshot version deployed here is likely to be
			out of date with the source code and changes listed.
		</p>
		<h3><a href="@project.scm.url@">Source code</a> head (the ever-changing latest version of the code is available.</a></h3>

</span><span id="RELEASE">
		<h3>This deployment is a RELEASED version</h3>
		<p>
			A RELEASED version is stable version of the application.
			The links below will reflect the exact source code and changes of this deployment.
